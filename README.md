#Currently undergoing a rewrite. Plex has changed the default movie agent and TheTVDB has changed their API to a subscription model, so I am looking into adapting to these changes.

Automatically find holiday movies/episodes on a Plex server and add them to a playlist.
Searches the Plex title, Plex plot, and IMDb keywords for each movie/episode for a keyword.

Required modules can be installed from an elevated command prompt on Windows machines:

    py -m pip install -r requirements.txt

Or on Linux machines with:

    # python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
